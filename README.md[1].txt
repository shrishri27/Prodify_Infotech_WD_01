This HTML project is a beginner-friendly, front-end web development exercise. It introduces me to several important concepts that are often used in modern web design. Below is a detailed explanation of what I learn from this code as an intern :

 1. HTML Structure & Semantic Elements
What I learn:
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML.

<html lang="en">: Defines the root of the document and the language(English).

<head> & <body>: Separates metadata (styles, title) from visible content.

<nav>: Semantic element for navigation bar (improves SEO and accessibility).

<section>: Semantic block for main content.

 As a student, understanding semantic tags helped me to write clean, accessible code and follow best practices.

 2. CSS Styling
Key Concepts Covered:
a. CSS Reset & Box Model
css

  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
This removes default browser spacing and fixes layout consistency issues.

b. Typography & Font Fallbacks
css

  body {
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans- serif;
   }
This sets a priority list of fonts for cross-browser compatibility.

c. Fixed Navigation Bar
css

  nav {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    ...
  }
A navigation bar that stays on top of the screen while scrolling. Useful for user experience.

d. Responsive Design
css

 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
 
Ensures the layout works on mobile and desktop screens.

e. Hover Effects
css

  nav a:hover {
    background-color: #fff;
    color: #c40876;
  }
Makes UI interactive and visually appealing.

f. Scroll Effects using Class Toggle
css

nav.scrolled {
  background-color: #4967cc;
  box-shadow: ...
}
I learn how to define an alternate style for a component when a condition is met (like scrolling).

 3. JavaScript DOM Manipulation and Events
What happens here?
javascript

  window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
    if (window.scrollY > 50) {
      navbar.classList.add('scrolled');
    } else {
      navbar.classList.remove('scrolled');
    }
  });
What I learn:
How to access elements using getElementById.

How to listen to user events (scroll in this case).

How to dynamically update CSS classes to change style (interactive behavior).

Basics of conditions (if/else) in JavaScript.

 This is a great intro to DOM manipulation and how JavaScript brings interactivity to static HTML/CSS.

 4. Practical Application and Purpose
The project is not just a design, but a mini web app for a travel agency — “Ramola Tour & Travels”.

I'am learning to:

Build a real-world landing page with a scrollable welcome section.

Write introductory content for customers (useful for both dev and content teams).

Use navigation menus that users can interact with.
